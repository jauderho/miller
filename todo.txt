RELEASES

* follow ...

================================================================
FEATURES

* better print-interpolate with {} etc
* Better functions for values manipulation, e.g. easier conversion of strings like "$1,234.56" into numeric values
  o Ability to specify some formats that are fixed. Like we can process
  "5d18h53m20s" format in *dhms* commands, but what about "5-18:53:20"? This is
  a common format used by the SLURM resource manager.
* sysdate, sysdate_local; datediff ...
* strmatch https://github.com/johnkerl/miller/issues/77#issuecomment-538790927
* sliding window / moving average
* shift_lead and shift_lag steps
* CSV default unsparsify ... note this must trust the *first* record .......
* rank
* DKVP encodings/decodings for \n etc

* csvstat / Panda's describe
* r-strings/implicit-r/297: double-check end of reference-main-data-types.md.in
? BIFs as FCFs?
* pv: 'mlr --prepipex pv --gzin tail -n 10 ~/tmp/zhuge.gz' needs --gzin & --prepipex both
  o plus corresponding docwork
* -W to mlr main also -- so it can be used with .mlrrc
? IP addresses and ranges as a datatype so one could do membership tests like "if 10.10.10.10 in 10.0.0.0/8".
? push/pop/shift/unshift functions

================================================================
UX

* broadly rethink os.Exit, especially as affecting mlr repl
* sync-print option; or (yuck) another xprint variant; or ...; emph dump/eprint
? trace-mode ?
* strptime w/ ...00.Z -> error
* main-level (verb-level?) flag for "," -> X in verbs -- in case commas in field names

================================================================
DOC

! link to SE table ...
  https://github.com/johnkerl/miller/discussions/609#discussioncomment-1115715
* document cloudthings, e.g.
  o go.yml
  o codespell.yml
    - codespell --check-filenames --skip *.csv,*.dkvp,*.txt,*.js,*.html,*.map,./tags,./test/cases --ignore-words-list denom,inTerm,inout,iput,nd,nin,numer,Wit,te,wee
  o readthedocs triggers
* doc
  o wut h1 spacing before/after ...
  o shell-commands: while-read example from issues
  E reference-dsl-user-defined-functions: UDSes -> non-factorial example -- maybe some useful aggregator
  o reference-main-arithmetic: ? test stats1/step -F flag
  o reference-dsl-control-structures:
    e while (NR < 10) will never terminate as NR is only incremented between
      records -> and each expression is invoked once per record so once for NR=1,
      once for NR=2, etc.
  o C-style triple-for loops: loop to NR -> NO!!!
  o Since uninitialized out-of-stream variables default to 0 for
    addition/subtraction and 1 for multiplication when they appear on expression
    right-hand sides (not quite as in awk, where they'd default to 0 either way)
    <-> xlink to other page
  r fzf-ish w/ head -n 4, --from, up-arrow & append verb, then cat -- find & update the existing section
  ! https://github.com/johnkerl/miller/issues/653 -- stats1 w/ empties? check stats2
    - needs UTs as well
  o while-read example from issues
w contact re https://jsonlines.org/on_the_web/
* verslink old relnotes
* single UT, hard to invoke w/ new full go.mod path
  go test $(ls internal/pkg/lib/*.go|grep -v test) internal/pkg/lib/unbackslash_test.go
  etc
* file-formats: NIDX link to headerless CSV
* window.mlr, window2.mlr -> doc somewhere
* sec2gmt --millis/--micros/--nanos doc
* sort-within-records --recursive doc
* back-incompat:
  mlr -n put $vflag '@x=1; dump > stdout, @x'
  mlr -n put $vflag '@x=1; dump > stdout @x'

 ===============================================================
TESTING

* RT ngrams.sh -v -o 1 one-word-list.txt
* pos/neg 0x/0b/0o UTs
* JIT UT:
  o JSON I/O
  o mlrval_cmp.go
  o mv from-array/from-map w/ copy & mutate orig & check new -- & vice versa
  o dash-O and octal infer
  o populate each bifs/X_test.go for each bifs/X.go etc etc
* xtab splitter UT; nidx too

================================================================
PERFORMANCE

* profile sort
* JSON perf -- try alternate packages to encoding/json
* more perf?
  - batchify source-quench -- experiment 1st
  - further channelize (CSV-first focus) mlrval infer vs record-put ?
  ? coalesce errchan & done-writing w/ Err to RAC, and close-chan *and* EOSMarker -- ?

================================================================
CODE-NEATENS / QUALITY

* ast namings etc
  ? make a simple NodeFromToken & have all interface{} be *ASTNode, not *token.Token
* []Mlrval -> []*Mlrval ?
* broad commenting pass / TODO
* cmp for array & map
o JIT neatens
  - carefully read all $mlv files
  - check $types & $bifs as well
  - proofread all mlrval_cmp.go dispo mxes
  - update rmds x several
* https://staticcheck.io/docs
  o lots of nice little things to clean up -- no bugs per se, all stylistic i *think* ...
* funcptr away the ifs/ifsregex check in record-readers
* golinter?
* all case-files could use top-notes
* godoc neatens at func/const/etc level

================================================================
TBF

* fmtnum(98, "%3d%%") -- ? workaround: fmtnum(98, "%3d") . "%"

* hofs section on typedecls
  o hofs+typedecls RT cases

* meta: nr, nf, keys
* transpose ...

* consider expanding '(error)' to have more useful error-text

* mlr -k
  o various test cases
  o OLH re limitations
  o check JSON-parser x 2 -- is there really a 'restart'?
    - infinite-loop avoidance for sure

* non-streaming DSL-enabled cut
  https://github.com/johnkerl/miller/discussions/613

* single cheatsheet page -- put out RFH?
  https://twitter.com/icymi_py/status/1426622817785765898/photo/1

? $0 as raw-record string -- ? would make mlr grep simpler and more natural ...

* IIFEs: 'func f = (func(){ return udf})()'
* BIFs in non-sigil context (UDFs already are)
* non-top-level func defs

* non-lite DKVP reader/writer

* full format-string parser for corner cases like "X%08lldX"

* non-blocker: array and string slices on LHS of assignments

* non-blocker: feature/shorthand for repl newline before prompt

* non-blocker: new functions:
  o new columns-to-arrays and arrays-to-columns for stan format

? gzout, bz2out -- ? make sure this works through tee? bleah ...
? zip -- but that is an archive case too not just an encoding case
  ? miller support for archive-traversal; directory-traversal even w/o zip -- ?
  ? as 6.1 follow-on work -- ?

* more about HTTP logs in miller -- doc and encapsulate:
  mlr --icsv --implicit-csv-header --ifs space --oxtab --from elb-log put -q 'print $27'

* also: write up how git status after test should show any missed extra-outs

* https://segment.com/blog/allocation-efficiency-in-high-performance-go-services/

* formats
  o https://brandur.org/logfmt is simply DKVP w/ IFS = space (need dquot though)
  o https://docs.fluentbit.io/manual/pipeline/parsers/ltsv is just DKVP with IFS tab and IPS colon
* do some profiling every so often

* bash completion script https://github.com/johnkerl/miller/issues/77#issuecomment-308247402
  https://iridakos.com/programming/2018/03/01/bash-programmable-completion-tutorial#:~:text=Bash%20completion%20is%20a%20functionality,key%20while%20typing%20a%20command.

* sliding-window averages into mapper step (C + Go)

* double-check rand-seeding
  o all rand invocations should go through the seeder for UT/other determinism

! quoted NIDX
  - how with whitespace regex -- ?
! quoted DKVP
  - what about csvlite-style -- ? needs a --dkvplite ?
! pprint emit on schema change, not all-at-end.

* widen DSL coverage
  o err-return for array/map get/put if incorrect types ... currently go-void ...
    ! the DSL needs a full, written-down-and-published spell-out of error-eval semantics
  o multiple-valued return/assign -- ?
    - array destructure at LHS for multi-retval assign (maps too?)

* UT per se for lrec ops

* libify errors.New callsites for DSL/CST
* record-readers are fully in-channel/loop; record-writers are multi with in-channel/loop being
  done by ChannelWriter, which is very small. opportunity to refactor.
* empty csv ... reminder ...

* het ifmt-reading
  - separate out InputFormat into per-file (or tbd) & have autodetect on file endings -- ?
  - maybe a TBD reader -- ?
  - InputFormat into Context
  - TBD writer -- defer factory until first context?
  - deeper refactor pulling format out of reader/writer options entirely -- ?

* dotted-syntax support in verbs?
* json-triple-quote -- what can be done here?

* unset, unassign, remove -- too many different names. also assign/put ... maybe stick w/ 2?
* go exe 17MB, wut. try to discover. (gocc presumably but verify.)
* fill-down make columns required. also, --all.
* check triple-dash at mlr fill-down-h ; check others
* clean up unused exitCode arg in sort/put usage.
  o also document pre/post conditions for flag and non-flag usages x all mappers
? emit @x or emit x -- should make k/v pairs w/ "x" & value -- ? check against C impl
i emitp/emitf -- note for-loops didn't appear until 4.1.0 & emits are much older (emitp 3.5.0).
  if i were starting clean-slate, i'd have had just a single `emit`.
* asserting_{type}: os.Exit(1) -> return nil, err flow?
* bitwise_and_dispositions et al should not have _absn for collections -- _erro instead
* ast-parex separate mlr auxents entrypoint?
* port u/window*.mlr from mlrc to mlr (actually, fix mlr of course)
* comment schema-change supported only in csvlite reader, not csv reader
* for-multi: C semantics 'k1: data k2: a:x v:1', sigh ...
* neaten mlr gap -g (default) print
! write out thorough min/max/cmp cases for all orderings by type
* silent zero-pass for-loops on non-collections:
  o intended as a heterogenity feature ...
  o consider a --errors or --strict mode; something
* [[...]] / [[[...]]]:
  o put '$array = [1,2,3,[4,5]]' is a syntax error unfortunately; need '$array = [1,2,3,[4,5] ]'
i https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delimiter#Delimiter_collision
* grep out all error message from regtest outputs & doc them all & make sure index-searchable at readthedocs
* short 'asserting' functions (absent/error); and/or put --strict or somesuch
* dev-note on why `int` not `int64` -- processor-arch & those who most need it get it
* tilde-expand for REPL load/open: if '~' is at the start of the string, run it though 'sh -c echo'
  o or, simpler, just slice[1:] and prepend with os.Getenv("HOME")
* doc shift/unshift as using [2:] and append
? ctx invars -> ptr w/ cmt
? string/array slices on assignment LHS -- ?
* beyond:
  o support 'x[1]["a"]' etc notation in various verbs?
  o sort within nested data structures?
  o array-sort, map-key sort, map-value sort in the DSL?
  o closures for sorting and more -- ?!?
  o or maybe just use UDFs ...
* consider -w/-W to stderr not stdout -- ?
* doc6 re warnings
* zlib: n.b. brew install pigz, then pigz -z
* regex-capture follow-on: https://github.com/johnkerl/miller/issues/388 is much cleaner
  o keep current syntax for backward compatibility
  o but encourage use of this
* docs nest simplers now that we have getoptish
